nxp - NXT-PLC

nxp is a framework that adds cyclic execution and distributed data exchange to John Hansens's NXC programming language.

The program is written for NXT firmware version 1.28.

To get the demo applications up and running:

1. Install John Hansen's NXC compiler and nxtcom tool. For this to work you probably need the Lego Fantom driver also.
2. Get two NXTs connected by a regular RJ12 cable from sensor Port 4 to sensor Port 4
3. Compile the example programs:

$ nbc masterapp.nxc -O=masterapp.rxe
$ nbc slaveapp.nxc -O=slaveapp.rxe

Connect "Master" NXT via USB and download:

$ nxtcom masterapp.rxe

Connect "Slave" NXT via USB and download:

$ nxtcom slaveapp.rxe

4. Run the program on each NXT and watch the counters on the displays. Unplug the cable and watch what happens. Reconnect the cable and watch what happens.

Options for masterapp.nxc are in mxpmaster.h. Here you can set the cyclic execution rate as well as the Master's name and the Slave's name.

Options for slaveapp.nxc are in nxpslave.h.
